# Seymour
## What is Seymour?

Seymour is an open-source and easy-to-configure active monitoring solution that allows users to simulate requests from globally distributed locations to test their API endpoints. For each test, Seymour measures the availability, response time, and correctness of the API endpoint response. We built Seymour to help engineering teams bolster existing testing approaches and handle the challenges of monitoring their increasingly complex systems. Our solution enables rapid detection of issues in production before users experience them. Seymour's infrastructure is easily deployed on your AWS account with two CLI commands.
